# This file provides example configuration commands that allow you to automate prerequisite configuration.
# These example commands are not included in the best practice base configuration template as they will differ for each customer.

# Ensure unused physical interfaces are disabled
# disable interface 1/3
# disable interface 1/4
# disable interface 10/3
# disable interface 10/4

# Set all redundant physical interfaces to be unmonitored for HA within System, Network, Interfaces
# set interface 1/1 -hamonitor off
# set interface 1/2 -hamonitor off
# set interface 10/1 -hamonitor off
# set interface 10/2 -hamonitor off

# All channels comprising redundant physical interfaces should be monitored for HA within System, Network, Channels
# set interface LA/1 -hamonitor on
# set interface LA/2 -hamonitor on

# All channels are bound to a separate VLAN and, you have taken care that no untagged channels are accidentally still in VLAN 1
# add vlan 100 -aliasname internal
# add vlan 200 -aliasname external
# bind vlan 100 -ifnum LA/1
# bind vlan 200 -ifnum LA/2

# Create an HA pair between your ADCs within System, High Availability
# On both HA nodes:
# add ha node 0 other-node-nsip

# Create and bind one SNIP to every VLAN, ensuring that each SNIP is in the subnet of the connected network
# add ns ip 192.168.1.10 255.255.255.0 -type SNIP -mgmtAccess DISABLED
# bind vlan 100 -IPAddress 192.168.1.10 255.255.255.0
# add ns ip 192.168.2.10 255.255.255.0 -type SNIP -mgmtAccess DISABLED
# bind vlan 200 -IPAddress 192.168.2.10 255.255.255.0

# Configure the routes that the ADC requires within System, Network, Routes
# add route 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.1
# add route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 192.168.2.1

# Create any Policy Based Routes required
# add ns pbr Management ALLOW -srcIP = <NSIP_of_first_HA_node>-<NSIP_of_second_HA_node> -destIP "!=" <first_IP_management_subnet>â€“<last_IP_management_subnet> -nextHop <management_subnet_router> - priority 1
# apply pbrs

# Make sure you can ping each SNIP with Mac Based Forwarding (MBF) is disabled or that you understand why you cannot
# disable ns mode mbf

# Ensure you have installed a new SSL certificate and key for the management GUI
# add ssl certKey "Example Cert" -cert mgmt_adc1_crt -key mgmt_adc1_key
